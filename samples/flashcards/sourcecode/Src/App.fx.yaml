            Question: "What is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)?",
            Answer: "A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of generative model that consists of two neural networks: a generator network that generates new data samples, and a discriminator network that tries to distinguish the generated samples from real ones.",
            Description: "GANs are a popular class of generative models that use two competing neural networks. The generator network generates synthetic data samples, while the discriminator network tries to differentiate between real and generated samples. The two networks engage in a training process where they learn from each other, resulting in the generator producing increasingly realistic data samples."

            Answer: "Style transfer in Generative AI involves the process of taking the style of one image or artwork and applying it to another image, creating a new image that combines the content of the original image with the artistic style of the reference image.",
            Description: "Style transfer is a technique in Generative AI that allows the transformation of the style of one image to another. By leveraging deep learning models, it becomes possible to extract the content and style representations from two different images and combine them to create a novel image that carries the content of one image and the artistic style of another."
